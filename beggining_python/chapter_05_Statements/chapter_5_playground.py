# Assignment magic 

x, y, z = 1, 2, 3

x, y = y, x

# Sequence unpacking

values = 4, 5, 6 

x, y, z = values

a, b, rest* = 1, 2, 3, 4

# Chained assignment 

x = y = 42 
 
# Augmented assignment 

x = 2 
x += 1
x *= 4

# Conditional statements 
'''
Apart from the if statement that I already knew, I learned how
python evaluates conditional expressions using lazy evaluation
or the so-called short-circuit logic. This method allow for the 
ternary operator to work in the Python language.

# Loops
'''
Python offers while- and for-loops. While-loops function in a 
similar fashion to what I am used to. For loops are ones to use
when wanting to iterate over all elements of a sequence list or 
other iterable objects. Iterables are any objects that can be 
iterated over or simply said used in a for-loop. 
Funnily enough, you can use else clauses at the end of loops, as
if the loop statement is an if-statement. This is useful when
you have a break in your loop and you want to handle the case
where the break is not reached.
